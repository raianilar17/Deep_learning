# DL_P2_Planar-data-classification-with-one-hidden-layer

I build neural network, which will have one hidden layer.

Also Compare  the performance between this model and logistic regression model. 


### Files:

2. [Planar_data_classification_with_onehidden_layer.ipynb](Planar_data_classification_with_onehidden_layer.ipynb) : complete project description

3. [planar_utils.py](planar_utils.py) : useful function

4. [testCases_v2.py](testCases_v2.py) : Sample data used to test function

### Command to Run code

Run in jupyter notebook(The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that 
allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 
Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, 
machine learning, and much more.)

Detail explanation is given in notebook. [Please refer](Planar_data_classification_with_onehidden_layer.ipynb)

The notebook written in deep explanation with mathematical function.

### Future Work

Improve the model accuracy

Use different Hyperparameters(leraning_rate, iterations...)

Use different Regularization technique.

Use different Architecture.

Apply on differant application(field/area).
