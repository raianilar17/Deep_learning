# Building-Deep-Neural-Network-Step-by-Step

The previous project, I trained a 2-layer Neural Network (with a single hidden layer). In this project, I build a deep neural network, with many layers.

    In this project, I implemented all the functions required to build a deep neural network.
    In the next project, I will use these functions to build a deep neural network for image classification.

### Files:

1. [Images](images) : Detailed Description
2. [Building_Deep_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step](Building_Deep_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step.ipynb) : complete project description
3. [dnn_utils_v2.py](dnn_utils_v2.py) : provides some necessary functions.
4. [testCases_v4a.py](testCases_v4a.py) provides some test cases to assess the correctness of functions.

### Command to Run code

Run in jupyter notebook(The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that 
allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 
Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, 
machine learning, and much more.)

Detail explanation is given in notebook. [Please refer](Building_Deep_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step.ipynb)

The notebook written in deep explanation with mathematical function.
    
    
### Future Work

In the next project, I will use these functions to build a deep neural network for image classification.
