# Built-Recurrent-Neural-Network-Step_by_Step

In this project, I have implemented key components of a Recurrent Neural Network in `numpy`.  
**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because they have "memory".**
They can read inputs  ùë•‚ü®ùë°‚ü©  (such as words) one at a time, and remember some information/context through the hidden layer activation's 
that get passed from one time-step to the next. This allows a unidirectional RNN to take information from the past to process later inputs.
A bidirectional RNN can take context from both the past and the future.

## Files:
- [data](data) - dataset
- [images](images) - images realted to RNN
- [Building_a_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step.ipynb](Building_a_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step.ipynb) : complete project description
- [rnn_utils.py](rnn_utils.py): pre-defined functions
- [utils.py](utils.py) : pre-defined Function

## Commands to Run Code :
- Run jupyter notebook([Building_a_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step.ipynb](Building_a_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step.ipynb)) 
(The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows us to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and
narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.)
- Detail explanation is given in notebook. Please refer [Building_a_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step.ipynb](Building_a_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step.ipynb) .
- The notebook written in deep explanation with mathematical function.

## Future Work
I'll implemnt RNN in different application such as speech recognition, music generation, sentiment classification, DNA sequence analysis,
Machine translation, Video Activity Recognition, Name entity recognition.
