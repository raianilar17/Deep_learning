# Operations-on-word-vectors

`
The word embeddings are very computationally expensive to train, So most of ML practitioners load a pre-trained set of embeddings. `

**Highlights of Project :**

- Load pre-trained word vectors, and measure similarity using cosine similarity , 
- Use word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to Woman as King is to ______ , 
- Modify word embeddings to reduce their gender bias 
- Cosine similarity is a good way to compare the similarity between pairs of word vectors.
    - Note that L2 (Euclidean) distance also works.
- For NLP applications, using a pre-trained set of word vectors is often a good way to get started.

# Commands to run code :

- Run jupyter notebook([Operations_on_word_vectors.ipynb](Operations_on_word_vectors.ipynb)) 
(The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows us to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations,
and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.)
- Detail explanation is given in notebook. Please refer [Operations_on_word_vectors.ipynb](Operations_on_word_vectors.ipynb) .
- The notebook written in deep explanation with mathematical function.

# Future Work:
- I'll apply on different real-world applications.
